# Verification Loop

Project-aware verification for Elixir/Phoenix. Reads `mix.exs` and `.check.exs` to discover tools, test commands, and custom aliases before running anything.

## Iron Laws

1. **Discover before running** — Read `mix.exs` first; never run `mix credo` if credo isn't a dependency
2. **Prefer ex_check** — If `:ex_check` + `.check.exs` exists, `mix check` replaces individual steps
3. **Prefer project aliases** — If `mix ci` or composite alias exists, use it over individual steps
4. **Run in order** — Later steps assume earlier ones pass
5. **Ask before E2E tests** — Unit tests run automatically; E2E/integration tests need user confirmation
6. **NEVER report success without showing actual command output** — "should work" is not verification

## Step 0: Project Discovery (ALWAYS FIRST)

Read `mix.exs` — extract `deps/0`, `aliases/0`, and `cli/0` (for `preferred_envs`). Also check for `.check.exs`. See `<skill-dir>/references/project-discovery.md` for full patterns.

**Discover tools** (deps): `:credo`, `:dialyxir`, `:sobelow`, `:ex_check`, `:excoveralls`, `:boundary`

**Discover test commands** (aliases + deps):

- Unit: `mix test` (always), or custom alias like `mix test.with_coverage`
- E2E: `mix playwright.test`, `mix cypress.run`, or similar (check `preferred_envs` for `MIX_ENV`)
- Fast E2E: `mix playwright.run` (skips setup — for re-runs)

**Discover composite runner**: If `.check.exs` exists, read it — `mix check` may handle compile, format, credo, test, dialyzer, sobelow, and more.

Report discovery:

```
Project tools: compile ✓ | format ✓ | credo ✓ | dialyzer ✓ | sobelow ✓ | ex_check ✓
Test commands: mix test (unit) | mix playwright.test (E2E, MIX_ENV=int_test)
Composite runner: mix check (.check.exs covers: compiler, formatter, credo, dialyzer, sobelow, tests)
Strategy: Running `mix check` then asking about E2E
```

## Verification Sequence

**CRITICAL**: Before using ANY discovered alias or composite command, verify it works:

1. Check the dependency is in `mix.lock` (not just `mix.exs`) — deps may not be fetched
2. Run the command — if it fails with "command not found" or dependency error, fall back to individual steps
3. Log the fallback: "mix check failed (ex_check not installed?), falling back to individual steps"

**If `ex_check` installed + `.check.exs` exists**: Try `mix check`. If it fails, fall back to individual steps.

**If composite alias found** (e.g., `mix ci`, `mix precommit`): Try it. If it fails, fall back to individual steps.

**Otherwise** (or after fallback): Run individual steps, skipping unavailable tools.

### Step 1: Compile

`mix compile --warnings-as-errors` — always

> **Elixir 1.20+ (OTP 27+)**: the compiler's built-in type checker emits **type
> violations / verified bugs** as warnings, so `--warnings-as-errors` now fails
> the build on them — no Dialyzer needed. If a previously-green build fails
> after a 1.20 bump, suspect a newly-detected type violation, not a regression.
> Read the message literally (accepted vs supplied type); it is almost always a
> real bug. See `elixir-idioms/references/elixir-120-type-system.md`.

### Step 2: Format

`mix format --check-formatted` — always (auto-fix with `mix format` if fails)

### Step 3: Credo

`mix credo --strict` — if `:credo` in deps, else skip

### Step 4: Test

`mix test --trace` — use project test alias if available

### Step 5: Dialyzer

`mix dialyzer` — if `:dialyxir` in deps, pre-PR only

### Step 6: Sobelow

`mix sobelow --config` — if `:sobelow` in deps

Skip unavailable tools with: "Credo: ⏭ Not installed"

### Step 7: Additional Test Offer

After core verification passes, check if project has additional test commands (E2E, integration, coverage). **Ask the user**:

```
Core verification passed. Additional test commands available:
1. mix playwright.test (E2E, MIX_ENV=int_test) — ~5min
2. mix test.with_coverage (unit + coverage report)
Run any of these? [1/2/both/skip]
```

Respect `preferred_envs` / `cli/0` for correct `MIX_ENV` on each command.

## Quick Reference

| Step | Command | Condition |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Discovery | Read `mix.exs` + `.check.exs` | Always first |
| Composite | `mix check` | If `:ex_check` installed |
| Compile | `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` | Always |
| Format | `mix format --check-formatted` | Always |
| Credo | `mix credo --strict` | `:credo` in deps |
| Test | `mix test --trace` | Always (use alias if exists) |
| Dialyzer | `mix dialyzer` | `:dialyxir` in deps, pre-PR |
| Sobelow | `mix sobelow --config` | `:sobelow` in deps |
| E2E/Extra | Ask user | If additional test commands found |

## Usage

1. Run `$phx-verify` — discovery happens automatically
2. Core checks run in order, adapted to project
3. After pass, offered additional test commands (E2E, coverage)
4. Commit only after all chosen checks pass
